##############################

#1. Installation
	- Operating system: Microsoft Windows
	- Frameworks: .NET Framework 4.5.2 or newer
	- Original project is written in Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2015, Update 1
	- Git clone files to your local repo and make a new project in Visual Studio
	- test-folder contains some data to test program with

#2. Specification
	## Purpose
		- MovieInfo is a simple movie library tool written in C# for retrieving movie information from Internet Movie Database (IMDB.com) and showing it in a simple GUI. You can pass it a folder which contains movie files and program tries to search if it can find anything about them from the Internet Movie Database.
	
	## Complete functionalities of the program
		- Search movie-files (.iso, .mp4, .avi, .img) from user specified location
		- Parse file names to be "human-readable" as well as possible
		- Query OMDB and see if any data can be found
		- Serialize and store objects to local SQLite-database
	
	## Incomplete functionalities of the program
		- Make GUI better
		- Add more options for the user to play with
		- Add more file formats
		- Improve file name parsing
		- More features 
			- Give user possibility to choose what data is displayed about the movie
			- Let user edit movie data in local database
			- Add functionality to play movie files by pressing button in the GUI (system default mediaplayer)

#4. Files required by the program
	## SQLite-database will be generated on the first launch of a program (it will be generated on the same folder as program is)
	
#5. Known bugs and things for the future development
	## Changing movie in the ListBox very fastly causes movie posters not to load correctly
	## Things to do in future; see chapter #2 -> Incomplete functionalities of the program

#6. Time schedule
